# Website Time Limit Extension

A chrome extension to limit time the user is allowed to spend on a website to improve efficiency.
The idea comes from the inability of Apple's Screen Time function in settings to limit websites visited on Chrome. I personally use Chrome because it transfers information between my computer and phone well, so I found it necessary to control my YouTube surfing. Instead of limiting by total time spent, which is kind of frustrating when you're watching a Top Gear highlight then suddenly your website is blocked, this extension limits WHEN you can access website, so you're forced to do work or sports or anything productive.

Since the Git is public, all changes are welcome!
